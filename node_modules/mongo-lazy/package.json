Eat a piece of cake while doing parallel queries.    \nAll the methods of node-mongodb-native are available. See [the official documentation][0].\n\n## Installation\n\n    npm install mongo-lazy\n\n## Usage\n    \n    node --harmony yourScript.js\n\nThe --harmony flag is necessary because we're using Harmony proxies to open and cache collections transparently.\n\n## Example\n\n``` js\n  // Open a db w/ the 3 args of mongodb.Db(dbName, servConfig, options) or w/ 1 obj-arg like above\n  var db = require('mongo-lazy').open({\n    db: 'yummy',\n    host: 'ds037987.mongolab.com',\n    port: 37987,\n    user: 'guest',\n    password: '123456'\n  });\n\n  // No need to open collections anymore, just call them as you would usually do with the mongo CLI\n  db.drink.findOne({name: 'Dom Perignon'}, function(err, domPerignon) {\n    console.log('A good wine:\\n', err || domPerignon, '\\n');\n  });\n\n  // The 'findAll' method returns all the elements of a collection (equiv to find + toArray) \n  db.meal.findAll({from: 'France'}, function(err, frenchMeals) {\n    console.log('French meals:\\n', err || frenchMeals, '\\n');\n  });\n\n  // Easy parallel queries: callback returns when all queries return or earlier if an error happened\n  db([\n    ['drink', 'findOne', {price: 'free'}],\n    ['meal', 'findOne', {price: 'cheap'}],\n    ['dessert', 'findAll', {quality: \"good\"}, {fields: {name: 1, _id: 0}}]\n  ], function(err, drink, meal, desserts) {\n    if (err) throw err;\n    console.log('Drink:\\n', drink);\n    console.log('Meal:\\n', meal);\n    console.log('Desserts:\\n', desserts, '\\nBon appetit!\\n');  \n  });\n\n  // Closing DB after 3 seconds\n  setTimeout(function() {\n    db.close();\n  }, 3000);\n```\n\n## Using the underlying mongodb-native `Db` object \n\nThe documentation of the mongodb-native `Db` object is [here][1].\nTo access and manipulate the underlying mongodb-native `Db` object,\nthere are 3 hooks on the mongo-lazy `db` object:\n\n* `db.close()` to close the database\n* `db.ready(listener)` to attach a listener which will be fired when `Db` is ready \n* `db.$` which is the mongodb-native `Db` object itself (or `null` when `Db` is not ready) \n\n\n## MIT License \n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Jie Meng-Gerard <contact@jie.fr>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\n\n[0]: http://mongodb.github.com/node-mongodb-native/api-generated/collection.html\n[1]: http://mongodb.github.com/node-mongodb-native/api-generated/db.html",

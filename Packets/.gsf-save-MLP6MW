1.Time variances of the differential rotation of this body create “jet streams” below the surface known as torsional oscillations. Features of this body in the x-ray spectrum such as Moreton waves were observed by the Yohkoh experiment. The Ulysses spacecraft studied the magnetic field lines of this body. The tacholine separates the larger, inner radiative zone of this body from its outer convective zone. This body is surrounded by its corona, and variations in the magnetic field of this star create its namesake flares. For 10 points, name this star, which is the closest one to Earth.
ANSWER: Sun [or Sol]

2.The narrator of this work asks “holy Light, offspring of heaven’s first-born” to let him “see and tell of things invisible to mortal sight.” Two characters in this work take their solitary way “hand in hand with wandering steps and slow.” Another character in this work resolves “to wage by force or guile eternal war irreconcilable to our grand Foe” despite the arguments of Belial and Mammon. In this work, Raphael warns two characters of the plans of a fallen angel who declares that it is better “to reign in hell than serve in heaven.” For 10 points, name this epic poem by John Milton in which Adam and Eve are expelled from Eden.
ANSWER: “Paradise Lost”

3.One of his works discusses the difficulty in calling the table he sits at a physical thing in the chapter “Appearance and Reality.” This man criticized Meinong's theory of objects in a work which contrasts “the present king of England” and the “present king of France.” A small china object in orbit between the Earth and Mars which is analogized to God is known as the teapot of this author of “On Denoting” and “The Problems of Philosophy.” Defining the set of all sets which are not members of themselves leads to this man's namesake paradox. For 10 points, name this philosopher who collaborated with Alfred North Whitehead on the Principia Mathematica.
ANSWER: Betrand Russell

4.Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of these compounds yields keto-enol tautomers. Oxidative cleavage of these compounds with potassium permanganate yields carboxylic acids. These compounds can be synthesized from aldehydes using an ylide (“ee-lide”) reagent in the Corey-Fuchs reaction, and can react with Lindlar’s catalyst to become more saturated. When these compounds react with dienes in the Diels-Alder reaction, the resulting cyclic structure has two double bonds. For 10 points, name this class of hydrocarbons which feature a carbon-carbon triple bond, whose simplest member, acetylene, is also known as ethyne. 
ANSWER: alkynes 

5.The adoption of an orphan in this work leads to an epidemic of insomnia. Another character in this novel repeatedly makes and unmakes golden fish. In this novel, one man is haunted by the ghost of a man he murdered named Prudencio Aguilar. Another man disappears with a group of gypsies and returns home to marry the earth-eating Rebeca. This novel includes a massacre of banana company workers. The first person to die in this novel’s setting is the gypsy Melquiades. Another character in this novel fathers seventeen sons, all sharing his name Aureliano. For 10 points, name this work about the Buendia family and their town of Macondo by Gabriel Garcia Marquez.
ANSWER: One Hundred Years Of Solitude [or Cien Anos De Soledad]

6.Palla Strozzi commissioned Fra Angelico’s depiction of this scene, which shows a man in red kneeling to kiss the feet of the central figure. Yellow and pink cloth hang from an object in Perugino’s version of it; that object is absent in Pontormo’s blue-dominated version of it. Another version of this scene shows a skull right below a woman in a bright blue dress lamenting on the ground. In addition to that painting by Van der Weyden, Rubens painted a triptych of this scene showing Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea standing on ladders while grasping a large white cloth supporting the titular figure. For 10 points, identify this scene in which Christ is removed from the cross.
ANSWER: Deposition of Christ [or Descent from the Cross before “cross” is read]

7.In this process, current can be adjusted using tightly wound coils in a process known as “shimming” in order to homogenize the involved magnetic field. This method can be used to calculate relatively long distances using the Paramagnetic Relaxation Enhancement. The simplest experiment using this method is the Continuous Wave experiment. The Larmor precession frequency is the rate at which the magnetic field rotates in this process, which most commonly uses either carbon-13 atoms or protons. For 10 points, name this spectroscopic technique applicable to nuclei with spin, which identifies the magnetic properties of nuclei.

ANSWER: nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy [or NMR spectroscopy]

8.This man vetoed the so-called “fifteen passenger bill” as being inconsistent with the terms of the Burlingame Treaty. He asked “Who is Wheeler?” upon the nomination of his Vice Presidential candidate. He campaigned on a platform including a return to the gold standard, but, during his self-imposed single term in office, Congress required silver coinage by passing the Bland-Allison Act over his veto. Despite his support of Republican Reconstruction efforts, his ascension to the White House was contingent on troops being removed from the South. For 10 points, name this nineteenth President who defeated Samuel Tilden in the disputed 1876 Presidential Election.
ANSWER: Rutherford Birchard Hayes

9.This state’s odder historical nicknames include the “Stubbed-Toe State,” and in 1995 its tourism department attempted to market the vanity plate “EZ 2 LUV” as a state slogan.

12.One of these structures synthesizes its namesake molecule from indole-glycerol phosphate and serine, and the fourth domain of that structure is commonly referred to as its “attenuator.” The inducer IPTG is often used in laboratories in conjunction with X-gal to detect if one of these structures is functional. These structures are transcribed as a unit into polycistronic mRNA. One of these structures codes for a permease enzyme and an enzyme that hydrolyzes its namesake polysaccharide, named beta-galactosidase. For 10 points, name these structures which code for several proteins that work in coordination, exemplified by the trp (“trip”) and lac ones. 
ANSWER: operons [accept trp operon before “IPTG”]

13.After being chosen by Ashpenaz, this man subsisted on vegetables and water for ten days rather than eat royal food. The Prayer of Azariah is sometimes included in his namesake book, along with the story of Bel and the Dragon, in which Habakkuk shares a meal with this figure. This figure interpreted a dream about a tile-footed statue made of gold, silver, bronze, and iron.

A temple to this figure from the Archaic Period is at Sounion in Attica. Hippolytus died as a result of a wish granted by this god to the son of Aethra, who slept with this god and Aegeus in the same night. This god gave the horses Balius and Xanthus to Peleus as a wedding present. Odysseus blinded this god’s son Polyphemus.

ANSWER: astroturfing [or rent-a-crowd]

19.In a failed attempt at a coup, Claude de Malet claimed that one side’s general had died on this campaign. In one of its last events, one force was decimated by cannonfire while struggling to cross two flimsy bridges over the Berezina River. One side during this campaign implemented a “scorched earth” policy to the point of burning down their own capital. During this event, Mikhail Kutusov could not stop the invading army at the Battle of Borodino, but that army suffered greatly attempting to retreat in the winter.

ANSWER: Antonio Lucio Vivaldi

21.One model of this phenomenon consists of a group of neural oscillators linked by a leaky integrator. Arien Mack and Irvin Rock introduced the terms “deafness” and “blindness” to denote sensory illusions caused by the lack of this phenomenon; the latter was demonstrated in a study asking people to count passes while a woman in a gorilla suit wandered into a video. Understanding a speaker in a noisy environment requires an application of this phenomenon in the cocktail party effect.

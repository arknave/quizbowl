This is a web interface for searching for quizbowl questions. 

Right now it uses NodeJS and ExpressJS, but most of the functionality is client-side.

It uses a REST API to interface with an elasticsearch database. Tossups and bonuses are supported, as well as a wide variety of subjects. 

Currently, only search is supported. There is no reader or multiplayer.
